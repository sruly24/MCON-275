Create a simple html page and css style sheet with some basic Javascript. (Links to an external site.)

For popup alerts, use a hyperlink (A tag) with the href attribute set to "javascript:alert('your text here');"

(Escape any single quotes in your text with \' or use the html entity &apos;  - https://www.w3.org/wiki/Common_HTML_entities_used_for_typography (Links to an external site.))

For images, you use an IMG tag with the SRC attribute set to a reference to the image file (for simplicity, put the image file in the same folder):
<IMG src="yourfilename.jpg">
 
Using an external CSS stylesheet the name, school and email shall be displayed in blue, green and red, respectively.

Add Javascript code to the HTML file to do the following:

1. When someone clicks your name, add an alert that pops up saying Hello World!

2. When someone clicks your picture, add an alert that pops up saying Don't send me any spam!

Make sure to test the file in a browser to make sure CSS styles are applied and your Javascript works.

Place ALL THE FILES into a single folder named Assignment 1 and zip that folder (i.e. compress it). Make sure the extension of the compressed folder is .zip. All homeworks must be submitted this way all semester

Upload the zip file to this assignment. DO NOT submit individual files.
